# Setting up development environment
- Ensure dotnet 5.0 SDK is installed
- Run `make init`, it executes:
    - `dotnet restore` to restore all project dependencies
    - `dotnet tool restore` to restore tools used for the project

# Database migrations
- Currently not in use
- Ensuring schema changes are reflected in database:
```
rm -rf Migrations/
rm -f database.db
dotnet ef migrations add "Initial" && dotnet ef database update 
```
- Or just run `make db-reset`
